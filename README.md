XBindJoy
========

XBindJoy is a program that translates joystick and joypad events into shell commands, mouse movements, or keypresses.

Current Status
==============

The code is unclean and I have a sneaking suspicion that there's a style guide somewhere I'm not following, but buttons work! Closures and varaible bindings mean that XBindJoy is already a more powerful joystick macro tool than anything else out there.
