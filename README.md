XBindJoy
========

XBindJoy is a tool for making your joysticks and gamepads more
useful. It lets you use GNU Guile to bind arbitrary scheme code to
joystick button presses and joystick axis movements, and provides
function calls to send synthetic key presses, mouse clicks, and mouse
movements from those procedures. Guile makes it easy to bind hotkeys
to joystick button chords, radically change hotkey functionality at
runtime, and more.
