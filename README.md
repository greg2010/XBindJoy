XBindJoy
========

XBindJoy is a tool for making your joysticks and gamepads more
useful. It lets you use GNU Guile to bind arbitrary scheme code to
joystick button presses and joystick axis movements, and provides
function calls to send synthetic key presses, mouse clicks, and mouse
movements from those procedures. Guile makes it easy to bind hotkeys
to joystick button chords, radically change hotkey functionality at
runtime, and more.

Disclaimer
==========

I am by no means a software engineer. This code is full of badness and there
are bugs everywhere. The build system is junk and even if by some
miracle you manage to get it running you won't be able to install it.

Good luck.
